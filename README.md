# Table Scraper

This Python script is designed to scrape tabular data from a specified Wikipedia page using the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and pandas for display.
Currently it only shows the most frequent words in a wikipedia article, but I plan to add more features such as sentiment analysis soon

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `Matplotlib`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib
